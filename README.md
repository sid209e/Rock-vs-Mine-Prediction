# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

This repository contains the code and analysis for a machine learning project that focuses on predicting whether an object detected by SONAR signals is a rock or a mine. The project utilizes the SONAR dataset and applies the Logistic Regression algorithm for classification.

## Introduction

SONAR is a widely used technology for underwater object detection and navigation. It emits sound waves and analyzes the returning signals to identify objects in the water. In this project, we aim to build a predictive model that can accurately classify objects detected by SONAR signals as either rocks or mines. Accurate classification is crucial for various applications, such as marine exploration, environmental monitoring, and underwater security.

## Dataset

The SONAR dataset used in this project consists of features extracted from SONAR signals along with their corresponding labels. Each instance in the dataset represents a sonar reading of an object, and the features are numerical values derived from the sound waves. The labels indicate whether the object is a rock or a mine. The dataset allows us to train a machine learning model to recognize patterns in the features and make predictions on unseen instances.

## Data Collection and Processing

The "Data Collection and Processing" section includes the code snippets for loading the SONAR dataset into a pandas dataframe. The dataset is provided as a CSV file, and the code reads the file into memory. It also performs necessary data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, feature scaling, or encoding categorical variables. These steps ensure that the data is in a suitable format for training the machine learning model.

## Training the Model

The "Training the Model" section focuses on training the Logistic Regression model using the SONAR dataset. Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm for binary classification problems, such as ours. The code fits the model to the training data, allowing it to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between the features and labels. Model training involves finding the optimal parameters that minimize the prediction errors.

## Model Evaluation

After training the model, it is crucial to evaluate its performance to assess its predictive capabilities. The code in this section evaluates the accuracy of the trained model on both the training and test sets. Accuracy is a common metric used to measure the performance of classification models and represents the percentage of correctly predicted instances. By evaluating the model on both sets, we can assess whether it is overfitting or generalizing well to unseen data.

## Making Predictions

The "Making a Predictive System" section demonstrates how to use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. The code includes an example of creating an input data instance, converting it to a numpy array, reshaping the array, and predicting the class label using the trained model. This section highlights the practical use of the trained model to classify real-world objects detected by SONAR signals.

## Requirements

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, you need to have the following dependencies installed in your Python environment:

- NumPy: For numerical computing and array operations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
